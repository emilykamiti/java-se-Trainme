# constructors

1. Method overloading

2. Constructor overloading

3. this keyword

4. static key word

overloading: same method/constructor many times./ A class contains more than one method with the same nae is called overloading

constructor overloading: class conatains more than one constructor is called constructor overloading.

Simple rules:

1. number of parameters: should be different/ or method taking and another not taking any parameters.
2. order of parameters: one can have m1(int a, int b) the other m1(int a, double b).
3. Data types: can be different

## constructor

1. Special type of method.

2. Constructor should have the same name as the class name

3. Constructor will not return any value

4. Will be invoked at a time of object creation.(no need to call the constructor explicitly)

5. Constructor will take the parameters (just like the method)

6. Constructor is used for initializing the values.

## Difference between constructor and Method

Constructor takes parameters but does not return any value, method returns a value.
