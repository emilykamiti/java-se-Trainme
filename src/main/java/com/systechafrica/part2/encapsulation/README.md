# Encapsulation

Binding of data in a class

Declare class variables/attributes as private

Provide public get ad set methods to access and update the value of a private variable

## Why Encapsulation

Better Control of class attributes and methods
Class attributes can be made read-only (if you only use the get method), or (write only if you use the SET method)
Programer can change one part of the code without affecting othe parts
Security of date.
